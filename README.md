# Running TheBus Webiste! 🚌
Quinn McHenry, Logan Lasell, Ashley Holen

For our CS 401 Software Engineering and Design Spring 2025 final project, our group decided to create a web based software application which assists the general public in navigating public transportation systems, specifically TheBus on O’ahu. Our website provides a user-friendly and accessible resource for users to quickly and easily find the bus which is that of their best interest. We have three features of the website - locating the buses nearest to you, finding the buses based on address, and finding the nearest bus stops.

Below are the instructions needed to run our website created as our website!

In this assignment, we used Docker to containerize 2 python files, routes.py and test_routes.py. 
When app.py runs, a Flask app starts, allowing for the user to use the API from their local device by URL. 
The test_app.py is used to ensure the accuracy of app.py using pytest. Below are instuctions how to run this webiste on your local device.
